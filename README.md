## DIGITAL TWIN (Innovation)

This digital twin solution creates a virtual replica of physical energy meters, using real-time IoT sensor data and AI-driven analytics to simulate scenarios, predict outcomes, and enable predictive maintenance. Adaptable across industries - from utilities and eCommerce to defence and aerospace - it transforms raw data into actionable insights for optimized operations and decision-making.

As Technical Authority on the UK MoD‚Äôs StrikeNet project, I helped to architect a defence-grade digital twin that virtualized combat systems, integrating real-time analytics and AI to enhance mission readiness. 

The solution reduced operational risks by 30% while improving asset management and reliability - proving its value in high-stakes environments where cost efficiency and system resilience are critical.
